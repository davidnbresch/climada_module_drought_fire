This zip file supplied contains the data for the requested dates in your area-of-interest. Depending on the date range selected you may receive 1 or 2 files containing: <br> <br>
i)	<i>_NRT files (e.g. firmsxxxxxNRT.shp, firmsxxxxxNRT.csv)</i> contain MCD14DL data: : Near Real-Time (NRT) MODIS Thermal Anomalies / Fire locations processed by NASA FIRMS, part of the Land Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE).  
<br><br>
and/or
<br><br>
ii)	<i>_MCD14ML files (e.g. firmsxxxx_MCD14ML.shp, firmsxxxx_MCD14ML.csv) </i> contain MCD14ML Standard/science Quality MODIS Thermal Anomalies / Fire locations processed by the University of Maryland with a  3-month lag and distributed by NASA FIRMS. These data replace the MCD14DL when available. <br><br>
Both MCD14ML and MCD14DL are processed using the same MOD14 Fire and Thermal Anomalies Algorithm but the NRT version (MCD14DL) uses predicted (attitude and ephemeris) geolocation and the standard / science quality version (MCD14ML) uses definitive (attitude and ephemeris) geolocation.  <br><br>
The difference between MODIS geolocation when using predicted vs. definitive attitude and ephemeris is routinely less than 100 meters. However, there are situations, particularly before and after spacecraft maneuvers and during space weather events, when the difference can increase up to several kilometers. The recommendation from EOSDIS is to reprocess data when the definitive attitude and ephemeris data become available. <br><br>
The reason the files are split is to ensure users clearly distinguish between these two data sources. Should you wish to combine the datasets you will still be able to distinguish the source using the Collection. Version 5.0 indicates the data is the NRT version of Collection 5 data. Version 5.1 is the standard/science quality version of Collection 5.

Please note that there are data missing from several of the data sets. There is data missing from end of June to the beginning of July in 2001, 2002 is missing some data throughout the data set, 2007 has some missing data from mid August and data is missing for part of 21 April 2009, and missing for 22 April 2009. There might also be some erroneous data present in the data set. Please refer to the disclaimer below.<br><br>
